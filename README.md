# Login Project

This project was created while while I was taking "React - The Complete Guide (incl Hooks, React Router, Redux)" course (https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux).

The software present a login form, validates user inputs and simulates user logging in. If any input is invalid, its color is changed to indicate something is wrong.

The project was a challenge, to test if react concepts were learnt. I wrote all the code by myself, including styles.

The project was deployed to Vercel, available at: https://login-winstein27.vercel.app/

## Study objectives

While developing this project, I practiced basic react concepts. Managing states and side effects, working with events, rendering lists and content conditionally. Then, I styled the components using CSS Modules. At last, I wrote unit test to the components.

## Running the project

After cloning the repository, open the terminal and go to the project's folder.

Run the command:

```
npm install
```

Wait until the installation process end.

Then run the command:

```
npm start
```

It should open your browser on http://localhost:3000. If not, open the browser manually and enter the previous url.
